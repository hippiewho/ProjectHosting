# Project Hosting Website!

The purpose of this project is to give me, personally, the ability to show of projects and blog posts that outline and show what I'm currently or have been working on. The Project is designed to work alongside a MSSQL database server. The MSSQL database holds relevant information such as login info as we'll as the Project information that is displayed. I also envision this to be easily adoptable by other people although currently may not be mature enough for widespread use.
